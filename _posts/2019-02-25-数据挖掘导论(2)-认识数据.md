# Chap 2 Getting to Know Your Data
<br />


**数据对象** : A data object represents an entity. Data objects can also be referred to as samples, examples, instances, data points, or objects. If the data objects are stored in a database, they are data tuples.

**属性** : An attribute is a data field, representing a characteristic or feature of a data object. The nouns attribute, dimension, feature, and variable are often used interchangeably.

observed values (观测值) for a given attribute are known as observations (观测)

A set of attributes used to describe a given object is called an attribute vector (or feature vector)

<br />
### 标称属性 (normal attributes)

Nominal means “relating to names.” The values of a nominal attribute are symbols or names of things. Each value represents some kind of category, code, or state, and so nominal attributes are also referred to as categorical (分类的). The values do not have any meaningful order (序). In computer science, the values are also known as enumerations (枚举的).

<br />
### 二元属性 (binary attributes)

A binary attribute is a nominal attribute with only two categories or states: 0 or 1

<br />
### 序数属性 (ordinal attributes)

An ordinal attribute is an attribute with possible values that have a meaningful order or ranking among them, but the magnitude between successive values is not known.

<br />
### 数值属性 (numeric attributes)

A numeric attribute is quantitative; that is, it is a measurable quantity, represented in integer or real values. Numeric attributes can be interval-scaled (区间标度, measured on a scale of equal-size units) or ratio-scaled (比率标度, with an inherent zero-point).

<br />
### 离散属性与连续属性 (Discrete versus Continuous Attributes)

A discrete attribute has a ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite set of values. If an attribute is not discrete, it is continuous.

## 数据的基本统计描述
<br />

### 中心趋势度量：均值、中位数和众数
<br />

**中列数** (midrange): It is the average of the largest and smallest values in the set.

### 度量数据散布：极差、四分位数、方差、标准差和四分位数极差
<br />

**极差**（range）：The range of the set is the difference between the largest (max()) and smallest (min()) values.

**分位数**：Quantiles are points taken at regular intervals of a data distribution, dividing it into essentially equalsize consecutive sets.

**四分位数极差** $$IRQ=Q_{3}-Q_{1}$$

$$Q_{1}$$ is the first quartile, $$Q_{3}$$ is the third quartile

**五数概括** (five number summary) : consists of the median ($$Q_{2}$$), the quartiles $$Q_{1}$$ and $$Q_{3}$$, and the smallest and largest individual observations, written in the order of Minimum, $$Q_{1}$$, Median, $$Q_{3}$$, Maximum

**盒图** (boxplot) : popular way of visualizing a distribution. A boxplot incorporates the ﬁve-number summary as follows:

+ Typically, the ends of the box are at the quartiles so that the box length is the interquartile range.
+ The median is marked by a line within the box.
+ Two lines (called whiskers) outside the box extend to the smallest (Minimum) and largest (Maximum) observations.

### 度量数据的相似性和相异性
<br />

A **cluster**（簇）is a collection of data objects such that the objects within a cluster are similar to one another and dissimilar to the objects in other clusters.

**Data matrix** (or object-by-attribute structure): This structure stores the n data objects in the form of a relational table, or n-by-p matrix (n objects ×p attributes):
