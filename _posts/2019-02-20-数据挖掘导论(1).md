# Chap 1 Introduction
<br />

**Data mining** is the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data.

The data sources can include databases, data warehouses, the Web, other information repositories, or data that are streamed into the system dynamically.

There are a number of data mining functionalities.

+ 数据特征化与数据区分

**Data characterization** is a summarization of the general characteristics or features of a target class of data.

**Data discrimination** is a comparison of the genaral features of the target class data objects againsts the general features of objects from one or multiple contrasting classes.

+ 频繁模式

**Frequent patterns**, as the name suggests, are patterns that occur frequently in data.

+ 关联和相关性挖掘
+ 分类与回归（用于预测分析）

**Classification** is the process of finding a **model** or function that describes and distinguishes data classes or concepts. The models are derived based on the analysis of a set of training data, the derived model may be represented in various forms:

a **Decision tree** (决策树) is a flowchat-like tree structure, where each node denotes a test on an attribute value, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and tree leaves represent classes or class distributions. Decision trees can easily be converted to classification rules.

A **neural network**（神经网络）,when used for classification, is typically a collection of neuron-like processing units with weighted connections between the units.

classification and regression may need to be preceded by **relevance analysis** （相关分析）, which attempts to identify attributes that are significantly relevant to the classification and regression process. Such attributes will be selected for the classification and regression process. Other attributes, which are irrelevant, can then be excluded from consideration.

**Regression analysis** is a statistical methodology that is most often used for numeric prediction.

+ 聚类分析

**Clustering** analyzes data objects without consulting class labels, unlike classification and regression, which analyze class-labeled (training) data sets. Clustering can be used to generate class labels for a group of data. The objects are clustered or grouped based on the principle of **maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity.**

+ 离群点分析

a data set may contain objects that do not comply with the general behavior or model of the data. These data objects are **outliers**.
