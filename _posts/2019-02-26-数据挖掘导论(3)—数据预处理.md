# Chap 3 Data Preprocessing
<br />

<br />
## 数据预处理：概述

**Data cleaning 数据清理** routines work to “clean” the data by filling in missing values, smoothing noisy data, identifying or removing outliers, and resolving inconsistencies.

**Data reduction 数据归约** obtains a reduced representation of the data set that is much smaller in volume, yet produces the same (or almost the same) analytical results. Data reduction strategies include dimensionality reduction 维归约 and numerosity reduction 数值归约.

Normalization, data discretization, and concept hierarchy generation are forms of **data transformation 数据变换**.

**Noise 噪声** is a random error or variance 随机误差或方差 in a measured variable.

<br />
###数据光滑技术 ：

**binning 分箱** : binning methods smooth a sorted data value by consulting its " neighborhood ", that is, the values around it.

The sorted values are distributed into a number of “buckets,” or bins.

Because binning methods consult the neighborhood of values, they perform local smoothing 局部光滑.

smoothing by bin means 用箱均值光滑

smoothing by bin medians 用箱中位数光滑

smoothing by bin boundaries 用箱边界光滑
