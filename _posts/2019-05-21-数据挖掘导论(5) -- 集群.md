## what is clustering

Clustering is the process of grouping a set of physical or abstract objects into classes of similar objects.

## distance measures

a distance measure should satisfy following requirements:

+ $$d(i,j)\geq 0$$
+ $$d(i,i)= 0$$
+ $$d(i,j)=d(j,i)$$
+ $$d(i,j)\leq d(i,h) + d(h,j)$$

Minkowski distance:

$$d(x_{1},x_{2})=\lgroup \sum_{k=1}^{d}{}(x_{1}(k)-x_{2}(k))^{p}\rgroup ^{\frac{1}{p}}$$
